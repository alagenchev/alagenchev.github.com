My name is Ivan Alagenchev.
I am a PhD student at the Computer Science Department of the University of Virginia under the guidance of prof. David Evans. I'm also a technologist, programmer and an entrepreneur. 
I am a fan of open source technologies and I have contributed to some (firefox for example).

I firmly believe in personal and political freedoms and that a vocal and active populace is a prerequisite for democracy to prosper. I believe in equal opportunity regardless of race and gender and would like to see more minorities and women in the field of computer science. Some of those views might spill onto these pages.
The primary purpose of this place is for me to write interesting things for my own benefit - I am getting old and cenile and this will help me fight with my own memory loss. Since these pages are nothing more than a brain dump of an old cenile man, they should not be taken seriously. None of the views expressed here have anything to do with the opinions of past and future employers, family or friends. They simply know better than to share my views.

Profesionally, I've worked with a large number of different languages and technologies - from x86, AT&T and MIPS assembly to Scheme, Java, C#, C and C++. I've written a C compiler, interpreter, hacked on Mozilla's javascript engine and browser, the Pastry overlay network protocol and a bunch of other stuff.
